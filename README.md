Project Overview
The document details a research project that develops a real-time vehicle accident detection and notification system using IoT technology. The goal is to reduce the delay in emergency response times after road accidents, a critical factor in saving lives, especially in developing countries like India.

System Components and Design
Hardware Module: The system utilizes an ESP-32 microcontroller, an MPU-9250 accelerometer for motion sensing, and a NEO-6M GPS module for location tracking. These components work together to detect accidents by analyzing changes in vehicle orientation and acceleration. When an accident is detected, the hardware module transmits the driver’s details and vehicle location to a centralized server.

Software - Android Application: An Android application, built with Flutter, acts as the user interface, offering features like real-time vehicle tracking, past route history, and emergency alert notifications. In the event of an accident, the app sends alerts to pre-designated emergency contacts if the driver does not dismiss the alert within a set timeframe.

Server Infrastructure: The backend system is built on Node.js and MongoDB, handling data from the hardware module, managing user authentication, and facilitating real-time communication via web sockets. The server is configured to operate efficiently using Node.js with pm2 for process management and an Apache web server as a reverse proxy.

Key Innovations and Features
Enhanced Accident Detection: The system improves accuracy by using multiple sensor inputs (yaw, pitch, roll, and acceleration) and differential analysis to minimize false alarms.

User-Controlled Alerts: Before notifying emergency services, the system sends an alert to the driver, allowing them to dismiss it if the accident is minor or false. This feature reduces unnecessary emergency responses.

Plug-and-Play Design: The system is designed as an independent, plug-and-play unit that does not require integration with the vehicle’s internal circuitry, making it easily adaptable for any vehicle model.

Conclusion and Future Directions
The project successfully demonstrates a comprehensive solution for real-time accident detection and emergency alerting, combining IoT hardware, mobile applications, and cloud-based services. Future improvements include further miniaturizing the hardware for easier installation, integrating machine learning algorithms for more precise accident detection, and extensive real-world testing to validate the system’s performance.

The system represents a significant step forward in vehicle safety technology, aiming to reduce the time it takes for emergency services to respond to accidents, thereby enhancing road safety and potentially saving lives.
